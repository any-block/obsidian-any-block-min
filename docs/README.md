## Lightspot

- Syntax free
  - No new syntax、Syntax-free intrusion
  - This also leads to no excessive reliance on plugins. I think a good plugin should not cause - when you have used the plugin for a period of time, leaving it will cause the original content to deform, become unreadable or maintainable
- Extensible
  - Facilitate secondary development
- Flexible and powerful
  - Selector (Flexible)：The selection range is flexible, with six selection methods, making it simple and easy to use
  - Processor (Powerful)：Rich and diverse, powerful in function and highly scalable
- Multi-platform, strong universality
  - It can use: **Obsidian plugin, Markdown-it plugin, Online App, Vuepress plugin**
  - Blogs such as vuepress/vitepress that support markdown-it parsing

The above only shows **a few of** the processors of the plugin. In fact, it **supports a wide variety of processors and functions**. The processors can be freely combined in series, and in addition to the list selector, it also supports many other selectors such as headings, code blocks, and quote blocks. For more functions, please refer to the more detailed [documentation](https://linczero.github.io/MdNote_Public/%E4%BA%A7%E5%93%81%E6%96%87%E6%A1%A3/AnyBlock/)

## Visual editing - AnyMenu

It is recommended to use together with another plugin [AnyMenu](https://github.com/any-menu/any-menu/) developed by the author of AnyBlock, which can reduce the learning cost and quickly generate templates.
